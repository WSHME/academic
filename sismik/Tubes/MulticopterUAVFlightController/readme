NOTE : DO NOT ONLY COPY PASTE. 
The purpose of this repository is for students to keep improving and not redoing the basic things again and again so the quality of the assignment will increase

Materials Needed
- Quadcopter, with X frame configuration. If you have different multicopter, need to reconfigure with motion equation in the source code
- Microcontroller AVR based (such as Arduino)
- AVR environtment and uploader 
- there are source code for calibration, setup, and flight controller
- The setup are saved in EEPROM. Ensure your microcontroller has enough EEPROM space (most microcontroller is enough i think)
- The source code are available in C. The folder with title YMFC... is the original arduino code from J. Brokking (God Bless him)
